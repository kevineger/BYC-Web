        <p>
            The team at BYC believes that being a parent today is harder than ever. So many options from education to
            activities and products all readily available to us, that itâ€™s impossible to make informed decisions that
            best fits for your child. Therefore, we aim to build a community of parents, friends and supporters to share
            the best of everything for our children. Parents can also easily book classes for kids to explore their
            talents and increase exposure to different activities. Through an easy-to-book online system and a mobile
            app, parents can access any classes within their fingertips.
